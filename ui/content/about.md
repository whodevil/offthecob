I grew up in a creative community surrounded by artists, and "back to the earth" hippies. I found my creative path
through multi-media art, photography, music and programming. I think art and programming use a similar part of
the creative mind, the one that stretch us to think abstractly about things that don't exist in the physical realm.

Having abandoned social media for the most part, I've thought about building a blog where I could share some of
my ideas. In the attempts at this, I'd consistently get out into the weeds of some new technology (I am doing
this for fun after all) and never hit escape velocity on the project. I've used org mode in emacs for years to keep
notes, and it occurred to me, maybe I could use some of those notes into a series of articles, and these pages are the
result.
