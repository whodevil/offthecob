I grew up in a creative community surrounded by artists, and "back to the earth" hippies. I found my creative path
through multi-media art, photography, music and programming. I think art and programming use a similar part of
the creative mind, the part that stretches us to think abstractly about things that don't exist in the physical realm.

Having abandoned social media for the most part, I've thought about building a blog where I could share some of
my ideas. These pages are the result of that pursuit.
